# Color-Balance-and-Fusion-for-Underwater-Image-Enhancement
Implementation of a MATLAB code based on the IEEE transaction  "Color Balance and Fusion for Underwater Image Enhancement " . 
The following operations have been performed to enhance the under water image: 
"White Balancing of the image " -- To improve the image aspect by removing undesired color castings due to various illuminations or medium attenuation properties.
"Gamma Correction of the image "-- To correct the global contrast because white balanced images tend to appear too bright.
"Normalized Unsharp Masking "-- To compensate for loss of details in the under and over exposed regions after the gamma corrections.
After performing above operations, the Naive Fusion Process and Multi-Scale Fusion Process have been implemented.
